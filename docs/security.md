# Security Practices

## Security Components
- **ProtectedRoute**: Restricts access to authenticated users only.
- **RoleBasedRoute**: Restricts access based on user roles.
- **SecurityContext**: Provides authentication and role state globally.

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Validate user input on both client and server.
- Use HTTPS for all API requests.
- Handle errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information.
- Keep dependencies up to date.

## Authentication
- JWT-based authentication is recommended.
- Store tokens securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or secure storage).
